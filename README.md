During this project, I have achieved the following technical successes:
- Started using TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- Successfully implemented my first Jest test for improved code testing and reliability.

## Technical Challenges
While working on Garden to Table, I have faced specific technical challenges, which include:
- Striving for proficiency in TypeScript and Test-Driven Development (TDD), acknowledging that it's a continuous work in progress.

## For the Future
Looking ahead, here's what I plan for the future of this project:
- Continuing with the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Aiming to have a functional front-end soon, delivering a seamless user experience.
- Initiating the backend development using Django and Python to complement the front-end functionality.
